1)	To my opinion, the 5 topics of interest in Computer Science involves GIS (Geographic Information Systems), cyber security, artificial intelligence, networking, and computer graphics. 
2)	I wanted to pursue a career involving the aspects of environmental technology and how it applies to conserving and protecting the natural environment.
3)	I am still currently undecided on where my interests and experience will launch me into my new career, but Iâ€™m interested in my natural surroundings and developing technology. By fulfilling the goal of conserving the environment, I would be able to monitor its natural status & curb the negative effects of human activities. Learning the fundamentals of computer programs and web development can help determine its role in detecting natural processes, patterns, and occurrences.
4)	As a future conservation scientist or environmental technician, I am expecting a salary estimating over $50,000 per year.

1) What is computer science?  
Computer Science is the study of algorithms
2)	Why is Python better than any other language? 
Because it is a powerful language, is portable and easy to learn 
3) What does ‘syntax’ mean? 
Syntax refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure.
4)	Which one of these is not a type of error ? 
lethargic error 
5)	What is an Algorithm? 
Steps used to solve a problem 
6)	What are two ways in which a program can be represented?  
Pseudocode and Flowchart 
7)	Which one these is NOT an example of an operator in Python?
Parenthesis Operator 
8)	Which of the following is an assignment operator? 
=
9)	What are the four steps involved in program development?
1- Understand the problem
2- Represent your problem
3- Implement te algorithm
4- Test and debug your program
10) Find the syntax error in the following and write the corrected form beside it:
        a) pnrit (“What’s up”)  answer: print
    		b) print (‘Hello) answer: "Hello"
    		c) a + b = c answer: (c= a + b) Variable should be on the left and the expression on the right
    		d) 5cats = 5 answer: (cats5) No variable should start with a number
11)	How are single line and multi-line comments made in Python? Write examples for each.
Single-line comments are written on only one line
ex. print("This is Anaiah Coates") #I am sixteen years old
Multi-line comments are written in more than one line 
ex. #I really
#love the 
#world
print("This is Anaiah Coates)
12) What is a variable? What is a string? Give examples for each.
A variable is a specific location for storing information/data vaules
ex. mypets= 13
A string is a value that can contain a number of characters
ex. print("Hello, everyone on Earth!")
13) What will be the output of the following:
   a) print (“10” + “10”)
   b) print (20 + 20)
a) 1010
b) 40 
14) How do you make the variable ‘gpa’ take a decimal type value? Write down your answer below.
gpa = int(input("Enter GPA: ")) answer: Replace "int" with "float" (gpa=float(input("Enter GPA: "))
15) Use the input keyword to take a numerical value from the user and find out whether it is negative, positive or zero. (Hint: Use If, elif & else)
num8= 5
if  num8 > 0:
print("the number is positive")
else:
  print("the number is negative")
16) pet1= Dog
pet2= Cat
pet3= Bird
pet4= Horse
pet5= Fish
if pet1:
  print("Take it for a walk")
elif pet2:
  print("Clean the litter box")
if pet3:
  print("Clean the cage")
if pet4:
  print("Clean the stable")
if pet5:
  print("Clean the tank")
